          <h2>Video Production</h2>
          <p>Creative industries today offer a variety of career paths, each catering to unique skills and interests. Among these, video production stands out as a dynamic field, combining technical expertise with storytelling to create compelling content.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>A career in video production can lead to diverse opportunities across industries, from entertainment and advertising to education and social media.

          <hr>
          <p>A career in web design offers a wide range of opportunities in industries like technology, marketing, and e-commerce. Web designers may start by creating basic layouts or templates and eventually grow into specialized roles such as user experience (UX) designers, front-end developers, or creative directors. They use coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help produce this. An example of the code students can make with the knowledge of this class is shown. </p>

          <p>Many students are drawn to this field because it blends artistic design with problem-solving and coding skills. As businesses increasingly rely on strong online platforms to succeed, web design continues to be a sought-after and rewarding career path.</p>
          
          <h2>Graphic Design</h2>

          <h2 class="blog-post-title size-H1">Debate on CTE Funding</h2>
          <p class="blog-post-meta">September 24, 2024 by <a href="#">Jacob</a></p>

          <p>At ITHS, we've gotten new funding- but we also need to think about which CTE academy should get the current funding as of right now. Let's see what opinions students at ITHS have to say.</p>
          <hr>
          <blockquote>
            <h3>First Claim</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>When deciding how to allocate funding, many believe that web design should be the top priority because of its importance in establishing a strong online presence. A well-designed website serves as the first impression for users and can significantly impact credibility and user engagement. Students often argue that investing in web design ensures better functionality and accessibility, making it easier for people to navigate and interact with the site. This, in turn, attracts more visitors and boosts the overall success of any project or organization.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <hr>
          <h3>Counter Claim</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>However, others think that video production deserves the funding because of its ability to captivate audiences in ways that static content cannot. Videos are a dynamic and engaging medium, ideal for storytelling and promoting ideas or products across various platforms. Other students say that videos can evoke emotions, explain complex concepts quickly, and leave a lasting impression on viewers. They believe that focusing on video production can help organizations connect with audiences more effectively and enhance their digital presence.</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Final Claim</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Still, some students feel that graphic design should not be overlooked, as it plays a key role in visual communication. They argue that strong, professional graphics are essential for branding and can make any website or video look polished and cohesive. However, many agree that graphic design is most impactful when paired with either web design or video production. Ultimately, while all three areas are important, deciding where the funding goes depends on the specific goals and audience of the organization.</p>
